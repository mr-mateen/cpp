            <h1>What is Cyber Security?</h1>
            <p>
                Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting critical systems and
                sensitive information from digital attacks. It's also known as
                information technology security or electronic information
                security. cybersecurity measures are designed to combat threats
                against networked systems and applications, whether those
                threats originate from inside or outside of an organization.
            </p>
            <p>
                A strong cybersecurity strategy has layers of protection to
                defend against cyber crime, including cyber attacks that attempt
                to access, change, or destroy data; extort money from users or
                the organization; or aim to disrupt normal business operations.
                Countermeasures should address
            </p>
            <h2>Network Security</h2>
            <p>
                Security measures for protecting a computer network from
                intruders, including both wired and wireless connections.
            </p>

            <h2>Application Security</h2>
            <p>
                Focuses on keeping software and devices free of threats. A
                compromised application could provide access to the data it's
                designed to protect stored on local machine or in cloud
            </p>

            <h2>Cloud Security</h2>
            <p>
                Works with confidential computing that encrypts cloud data at
                rest, in motion (accessed through application), and in use data
                (during processing), to support customer privacy, business
                requirements.
            </p>

            <h2>Information Security</h2>
            <p>
                Protects the integrity and privacy of data, both in storage and
                in transit.
            </p>

            <h2>Operational Security</h2>
            <p>
                It includes the process and decisons for handling and protecting
                data assets. The permissions user's have when accessing a
                network and the procedures that determine how and wher data may
                be stores and accessed, all fall under ths umbrella.
            </p>

            <h2>End-User Education</h2>
            <p>
                It addresses the most unpredicable cyber-secutiry factor. Anyone
                can accidentally introduce a virus in the system by failing the
                good security practices. Teaching users to delete or intall
                suspecious applications, plugin unidentified USB drives and
                other vaious important lesson to bypass the system secutiry and
                gaining access to the protected system.
            </p>

            <h2>Disaster Recover and business continuity</h2>
            <p>
                It defines how an orginization respondes to a cyber-security
                incident or any other event that may casue user to face downtime
                of the service. Disaster recovery policies dictate how the data
                is orginization restores the operations and information to
                return to the same operating capacity as before the the event
            </p>

            <h2>Storage Secutiry</h2>
            <p>
                This includes encryption and immutable and isolated data copes.
                These remain in the same pool so they can quickly be restores to
                support recovery, minimizing the impact of a cyer attack
            </p>

            <h2>The Scale of the Cyber Threat</h2>
            <p>
                The global cyber threat continues to evolve at a rapid place,
                with a rising number of data breaches each year. A report
                revealed that a shocking 7.9 billion records have been expose by
                data breaches in the first nine months of 2019 alone. This
                figure is more than double the number of records exposed in the
                same period in 2018.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the scale of the cyber threat set to continue to rise,
                global spending on cyber-security solutions is naturally
                increasing. Governments across the globe have responded to the
                rising cyber threat with gudance to help orginizations implement
                effective cyber-security practices.
            </p>
            <h2>Types of Cyber Threats</h2>
            <ol class="mb">
                <li>
                    <b>Cyber-crime:</b> includes individual or gorups targeting
                    system from financial gain or to cause disruption.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Cyber-Attack:</b> often involves prolifically motivated
                    information gathering
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Cyberterrorism:</b> is intended to undermine electronic
                    systems to cause panic or fear.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>How malicious individuals gain control over system?</h2>
            <h3>Malware:</h3>
            <p>
                Malware means malicious software, designed by hacker to disrupt
                or damage the victims computer or system. Often spread via email
                attachment or legitimate-looking download
            </p>
            <h3>Ransomware:</h3>
            <p>
                is a type of malware that locks down files, data94 or systems,
                and threatens to erase or destroy the data - or make private or
                sensitive data to the public - unless a ransom is paid to the
                cyber criminals who launched the attack.
            </p>

            <h3>Phishing / social engineering:</h3>
            <p>
                Phishing is a form of social-engineering that tricks the user to
                provide their own sensitive information. In phishing scams,
                emails or text messages appear to form a legitimate company
                asking for sensitive information, such as credit card data or
                login credentials
